Server-hosted client-based audio player.

Think WinAMP, without the fancy visualizations.

I'm not saying they can't exist later on, just the scope of the project doesn't really call it into play.

# Todo

- Can we use bootstrap?
- Playlist functionality
- No more globals. Just use session
- Highlighting on what's playing
